# Project: Chat App

Chat app (backend and frontend)

## Stack
- Language: Python 3.12, managed with `uv` (not pip/venv directly — `uv add`, `uv run`, `uv sync`)
- Web framework: FastAPI, served by Uvicorn (ASGI)
- DB: PostgreSQL, via SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async, `asyncpg` driver)
- Migrations: Alembic (`alembic/env.py` is wired to `app.db.Base.metadata` and `app.config.settings`, not `alembic.ini`, for autogenerate)
- Realtime: native FastAPI `WebSocket` routes (no Socket.IO/Channels library) — a single in-process `RoomConnectionManager` (`app/ws.py`) tracks connections per room and broadcasts
- Auth: session-based, via Starlette's `SessionMiddleware` (signed cookie, `itsdangerous`) — not JWT, sessions are revocable and avoid token-in-localStorage exposure
- WebSocket auth: authenticated at connect time by reading `websocket.session["user_id"]` (populated from the cookie during the ASGI handshake), not per-message
- CORS: any `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` origin is allowed with credentials (see `app/config.py` `socket_origins`) — needed since the dev client / real frontend run on a different port than the API

## Structure

```

## Schema (initial)
- `rooms(id, name)`
- `messages(id, room_id, user_id, body, created_at)`
- `users(id, name)`

## Conventions
- Message history loads via REST (`GET /api/rooms/:id/messages`) on joining a room; live messages come through the WebSocket after.
- "Who's online" presence is implemented (`presence_state` on join, `presence_diff` broadcasts) — in-memory per-process, not distributed. Fine for a single-instance deploy; would need rework (e.g. Redis pub/sub) if ever run with multiple app processes/workers.
- Don't add features not explicitly requested (no read receipts, typing indicators, etc. unless asked).
- SQL: Postgres only, no other DB assumptions.

# Frontend: DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS

**Design system:** [Official DaisyUI Figma Library]
(reference ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for file location)

## CRITICAL RULE
**Always use DaisyUI components and utility classes. Never invent custom component styles without explicit permission from the team.** If a DaisyUI component exists for a use case, use it — do not roll a bespoke alternative.

## Key DaisyUI components for this app

| Use case         | DaisyUI class(es)                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chat messages    | `chat`, `chat-start`, `chat-end`, `chat-bubble`, `chat-header`, `chat-footer`, `chat-image` |
| Buttons          | `btn`, `btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, `btn-sm`, `btn-circle`, etc.   |
| Text input       | `input`, `input-bordered`, `textarea`, `textarea-bordered`        |
| User avatars     | `avatar`, `avatar-online`, `avatar-offline`                       |
| Badges / status  | `badge`, `badge-primary`, `badge-ghost`                           |
| Navigation       | `navbar`, `menu`, `drawer`, `drawer-side`, `drawer-content`       |
| Layout           | `card`, `card-body`, `divider`, `hero`                            |
| Feedback         | `alert`, `alert-info`, `alert-success`, `alert-error`, `toast`   |
| Loading states   | `loading`, `loading-spinner`                                      |
| Modals           | `modal`, `modal-box`, `modal-action`                              |

## Theming
- Use DaisyUI semantic color tokens (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `neutral`, `base-100`, etc.) — never hard-code hex values or raw Tailwind palette colors for component colors.
- Dark/light mode is handled via DaisyUI's `data-theme` attribute — do not implement a custom theme switcher unless asked.

## Do not
- Write custom CSS classes that duplicate DaisyUI component behavior.
- Use raw Tailwind classes to replicate a component that already exists in DaisyUI (e.g., don't build a button from `px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-500` when `btn btn-primary` exists).
- Override DaisyUI component styles inline without a clear reason tied to a specific product requirement.

- Use `uv add <pkg>` to add dependencies (updates `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), `uv run <cmd>` to run anything in the project's environment. Don't use bare `pip`/`python -m venv`.
- Run tests with `uv run pytest app/tests`. Tests hit a real Postgres db (`chat_app_test` locally) — no mocking the database.

## Why the rewrite from Elixir/Phoenix
The original implementation (see `reference-application/`) worked, but deployment kept hitting toolchain friction on a small (512MB) DigitalOcean droplet: compiling Erlang/OTP from source ran out of memory, and once that was fixed, apt's packaged Elixir version was too old. Python was chosen to sidestep that entire class of problem — the target deploy OS ships a usable `python3` already, and `uv` manages exact interpreter/dependency versions without ever compiling anything.
